## Purpose
Provide a comprehensive quarterly review of product releases, team OKR progress, and business updates for executive presentation and strategic planning.

## Data Sources
- Slack messages from channels from config.json: teamChannels, productGeneral, productFeedback (product launches and feedback)
- **IMPORTANT: Use the `list_manual_sources_files` tool first** to see what files are available in the manual_sources folder
- **Use the `read_file_from_manual_sources` tool** to access files from the manual_sources folder, including:
  - Goodvibes export files (e.g., "Q3/Good-Vibes-*.csv" files)
  - Mixpanel PDFs (feature usage metrics) in quarterly folders
  - ARR and business metrics Excel files (e.g., "Q3/ARR Waterfall.xlsx", "Q3/Net Revenue Retention.xlsx")
  - Platform member activity files (e.g., "Q3/Platform Member Activity - manager.xlsx")
- Use the OKR board ID from config.json (ovOkrBoardId: xxxxxx)
- Use the filter H2_Jira_Discovery_Ideas filter from config.json
- Query Jira ideas/OKRs from the board to see what was completed/updated using the Atlassian MCP server
- Look for ideas that were resolved, closed, or updated during the time period
- Don't use the JiraTeams values as labels in the JQL search issues
